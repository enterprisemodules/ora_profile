# ora_profile::db_users
#
# @summary This class contains the definition for all the database users you'd like on your system.
# When these customizations aren't enough, you can replace the class with your own class. See [ora_profile::database](./database.html) for an explanation on how to do this.
#
# @param [Hash] list
#    A list of database users to define.
#    The default value is: `{}`
#    This is a simple way to get started. It is easy to get started, but soon your hiera yaml become a nigtmare. Our advise is when you need to let puppet manage your Oracle profiles, to override this class and  add your own puppet implementation. This is much better maintainable
#    and adds more consistency.
