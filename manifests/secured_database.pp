# ora_profile::secured_database
#
# @summary This is a highly customizable Puppet profile class to define an Secured Oracle database on your system.
# In it's core just adding:
# 
# ```
# contain ora_profile::secured_database
# ```
# 
# Is enough to get a secured Oracle 12.2 database running on your system.
# 
# This profile class is based on the more generic [`ora_profile::database`](./database.html) class, but extends this class with securing the database conforming to the Oracle Center for Internet Security (CIS) rules.
# 
# But sometimes you have specific uses cases that are not handled well by the standard classes. This profile class allows you to add your own code to the execution.
# 
# ## Stages
# 
# Defining and starting an Oracle database on you system goes through several stages(These are not puppet stages):
# 
# - [`database`](./database.html)         (Generic database definition)
# - [`cis_rules`](./cis_rules.html)       (Apply all Center for Internet Security (CIS) rules for the database )
# 
# All these stages have a default implementation. This implementation is suitable to get started with. These classed all have parameters you can customize through hiera values. The defaults are specified in the module's `data/default.yaml` file. 
# 
# ## before classes
# 
# But sometimes this is not enough and you would like to add some extra definitions, you can, for example, add a Puppet class to be executed after the `database` stage is done and before the `cis_rules` is done. You can do this by adding the next line to your yaml data:
# 
# ```yaml
# ora_profile::database::before_cis_rules:   my_profile::my_extra_class
# ```
# 
# ## after classes
# 
# You can do the same when you want to add code after one of the stage classes:
# 
# ```yaml
# ora_profile::database::after_cis_rules:   my_profile::my_extra_class
# ```
# 
# ## Skipping
# 
# Sometimes organisation use different modules and mechanisms to implement a feature and you want to skip the class:
# 
# ```yaml
# ora_profile::database::cis_rules:   skip
# ```
# 
# ## Replacing
# 
# Or provide your own implementation:
# 
# ```yaml
# ora_profile::database::cis_rules:   my_profile::my_own_implementation
# ```
# 
# This mechanism can be used for all named stages and makes it easy to move from an easy setup with a running standard database to a fully customized setup using a lot of your own classes plugged in.
# 
# Look at the description of the stages and their properties.
#
# @param [Optional[String]] database
#    Use this value if you want to skip or use your own class for stage `database`.
#    ## Use your own class
#    You can use hiera to set this value. Here is an example:
#    ```yaml
#    ora_profile::secured_database::database:  my_module::my_class
#    ```
#    ## Skip
#    You can use hiera to set this value. Here is an example:
#    ```yaml
#    ora_profile::secured_database::database:  skip
#    ```
#
# @param [Optional[String]] cis_rules
#    Use this value if you want to skip or use your own class for stage `cis_rules`.
#    ## Use your own class
#    You can use hiera to set this value. Here is an example:
#    ```yaml
#    ora_profile::secured_database::cis_rules:  my_module::my_class
#    ```
#    ## Skip
#    You can use hiera to set this value. Here is an example:
#    ```yaml
#    ora_profile::secured_database::cis_rules:  skip
#    ```
#
# @param [Optional[String]] before_database
#    The name of the class you want to execute directly **before** the `database` class.
#    You can use hiera to set this value. Here is an example:
#    ```yaml
#    ora_profile::secured_database::before_database:  my_module::my_class
#    ```
#
# @param [Optional[String]] before_cis_rules
#    The name of the class you want to execute directly **before** the `cis_rules` class.
#    You can use hiera to set this value. Here is an example:
#    ```yaml
#    ora_profile::secured_database::before_cis_rules:  my_module::my_class
#    ```
#
# @param [Optional[String]] after_database
#    The name of the class you want to execute directly **after** the `database` class.
#    You can use hiera to set this value. Here is an example:
#    ```yaml
#    ora_profile::secured_database::after_database:  my_module::my_class
#    ```
#
# @param [Optional[String]] after_cis_rules
#    The name of the class you want to execute directly **after** the `cis_rules` class.
#    You can use hiera to set this value. Here is an example:
#    ```yaml
#    ora_profile::secured_database::after_cis_rules:  my_module::my_class
#    ```
