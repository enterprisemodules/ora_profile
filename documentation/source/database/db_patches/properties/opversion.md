The version of OPatch that is needed. If it is not installed, Puppet will install the specfied version.
If you have defined patches for multiple homes, this version of the OPatch utility will be installed
in all of these homes from the patch_file specified. Recent versions of the OPatch utility are exactly
the same for Oracle versions 12.1 through 21, so it doesn't matter for which Oracle version you have
downloaded it.

The default value is: `12.2.0.1.33`
