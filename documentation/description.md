## Overview

The `ora_profile::database` class contains all the Puppet code to install, create and populate an Oracle database. This class is an easy way to get started. It contains the following stages (These are not puppet stages):

- `sysctl`           (Set all required sysctl parameters)
- `limits`           (Set all required OS limits)
- `packages`         (Install all required packages)
- `groups_and_users` (Create required groups and users)
- `firewall`         (Open required firewall rules)
- `db_software`      (Install required Oracle database software)
- `db_patches`       (Install specified Opatch version and install specified patches)
- `db_definition`    (Define the database)
- `db_listener`      (Start the Listener)
- `db_services`      (Define Database Services)
- `db_tablespaces`   (Define all required tablespaces)
- `db_profiles`      (Define all required Oracle profiles)
- `db_users`         (Define all required Oracle users)
- `db_startup`       (Make sure the database restarts after a reboot)

All these stages have a default implementation. This implementation is suitable to get started with. These classed all have parameters you can customize through hiera values. The defaults are specified in the module's `data/default.yaml` file. 

But sometimes this is not enough and you would like to add some extra definitions, you can, for example, add a Puppet class to be executed after the `systctl` stage is done and before the `limits` is done. You can do this by adding the next line to your yaml data:

```yaml
ora_profile::database::before_sysctl:   my_profile::my_extra_class
```
or after:

```yaml
ora_profile::database::after_sysctl:   my_profile::my_extra_class
```

If you want to, you can also skip this provided class:

```yaml
ora_profile::database::sysctl:   skip
```

Or provide your own implementation:

```yaml
ora_profile::database::sysctl:   my_profile::my_own_implementation
```

This mechanism can be used for all named stages and makes it easy to move from an easy setup with a running standard database to a fully customized setup using a lot of your own classes plugged in.

we provide you with a pre-installed environment, where you experiment with these Puppet types.
